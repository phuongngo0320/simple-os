# Simple Operating System
## OS Assignment of HCMUT, Spring 2023

Ah, the joys of academia! This project was undoubtedly the most challenging assignment of my academic journey. With countless hours of hard work, I navigated the complexities of building an operating system, tackling everything from schedulers and memory management to synchronization mechanisms.

The initial codebase? A labyrinth of complexity and bugs. (Seriously, why would the professors do that to us?) The tasks were often ambiguous and lacked clear demonstrations, making the process even more arduous.

Back then, my Git skills were non-existent. Every change was meticulously marked with comments like //update and //fix.

Despite the challenges, I managed to carry the team to victory, earning a perfect 10/10 and gaining invaluable knowledge along the way. It was truly a memorable and rewarding experience.
