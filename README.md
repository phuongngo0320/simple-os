Simple Operating System, OS Assignment of HCMUT, Spring 2023

No doubt, the most painful assignment. Lots of work. I literally carried the whole team. 

Working with everything from scheduler, memory management to synchronization mechanisms.

The initial code is complex and has some bugs... (why would teachers do this?). The tasks were ambiguous and not well demonstrated.

I didn't know how to use Git back in the days. Every changes were marked as comments: `//update`, `//fix`.

BTW, getting a 10/10 grade and learning a lot more things made it worthy. What a memorable experience.
